	  <h1 id="AbtMS">Mission Statement</h1>
	 <p id="mist">Our mission is to improve the overall quality of life for people with special needs by ensuring
	 their full participation and acceptance in society. We work with marginalised communities towards
	 their empowerment and help them to evolve a vision of an alternative society.</p>
	 
	 <h1 id="AbtAbt">About Us</h1>
	 <p id="abtabt">Here at Ashraya, we believe in a world where every
	 child is celebrated for their unique strengths and abilities. Our charity is dedicated to providing 
	 an education for children with special needs, as well as grassroots support and resources for
	 underprivileged children and families navigating the unique challenges of living with autism,
	 down syndrome and cerebral palsy. Founded in 2018 by Margadarshi 
	 Rural Development Association&#174;, we are based in Nelamangala &#40;Bangalore Rural District&#41;.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p id="abtabtc">Pupils at our school recieve a special education, physiotherapy and life skills training as well as
	 food, entertainment and medical facilities. As a charity, we also hold counselling sessions with
	 parents and work to spread awareness about intellectual disabilities in rural areas. </p>

		<h2 id="FounderI">About the Founder</h2><br>
		</div>
        <p id="founderi"> Ms Kamalamma grew up in rural Karnataka. Her strong background in social 
		service has given her a deep understanding of the challenges faced by rural communities. This 
		insight led her to become an influential member of her Gram Panchayat, where she served five years 
		as president. During her tenure, Ms Kamalamma became a trusted point of contact for government initiatives 
		aimed at rural development, assisting her community in accessing essential resources. </p><br>
		<p id="founderic">Her dedication 
		to social causes took a personal turn when she recognized, as a mother, the  lack of support for children with 
		special needs in rural areas. On observing the absence of any facilities in Nelamangala, a locality with a 
		population of over 100,000, she established Ashraya Special School to provide essential services for
		children with special needs. Ashraya Special School was founded with the mission to support not only the
		children but also their parents and caregivers, offering them peace of mind and a reliable support system.
		Through her vision, Ms. Kamalamma continues to be an advocate for inclusivity, ensuring that every child
		recieves the care and resources they deserve.</p></div>
