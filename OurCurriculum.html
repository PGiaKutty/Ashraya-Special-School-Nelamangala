			<p id="timi"> Our school runs five days a week, from 9am to 4pm. Pupils follow the curriculum
			set by <a href="https://niepid.nic.in">NIEPID</a>, a national institute which sets a syllabus
			followed by most special schools in India. 
			<br></p>
			<p id="timic">The curriculum consists of five different areas. These include self-help skills, 
			motor skills (grasping and fine) and speech and language - both receptive and communicative. Under the NIEPID
			syllabus, pupil are also taught social skills, such as manners and polite conversation, which help them to 
			mix in society. Additionally, student learn functional academics, i.e. basic literacy and numeracy, identifying objects
			and the concepts of money and time.

        <p id="vocatp"> When we feel pupils are ready for next steps, they start a pre-vocational course.
		Some of the skills they develop include patience (e.g. Sitting in a chair for a while), self-control, 
		co-operation, and self-management skills, all of which will serve them well later on in life.
		<br><br>
		Pupils graduate at the age of 18, although none of our pupils have reached that age yet.</p>

<p id="fee">The full fee for the course is ₹2000 ($25) per month or ₹3000 ($35) plus transportation. 
   However, most families pay according to their economic status as opposed to the official full price.</p>
